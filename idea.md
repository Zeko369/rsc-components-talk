Components allowed you to bring in

-> interactivity (JS)
-> styling

Let's go back to our example

-> moves DB call to RSC

-> ok, ok, this is starting to look nice

-> what about commenting?

-> action ðŸ”¥

-> but how to pass our own db / migrations?
  => drizzle example with entites

-> notion-rsc

> Ok, but besides a dumb commenting example, what else could we build with this?
-> glad you asked

-> there is a really good product used by the react community by the skater boi from california
-> but sometimes you need to use your own buckets / have other requirements

=> action -> client -> button

How about a stripe handling UI?
-> pass user email and then render go to checkout / go to billing screen

> So where / why / how?
-> well sadly, only next right now
-> but remix and TS soon

> But why?
-> you could get a similar thing by mounting a few endpoints / doing manual prefetching?

-> well I started asking myself something similar after working on this talk
-> RSC is some great tech, streaming SSR, packaging server actions, less boilerplate, less data sent, faster hydration

but it has issues

=> Still locked into Next appDir
  -> despite the fact I've used this for years in prod, still don't think it's the correct solution for a lot of cases
=> Still no "server functions"
=> Still no "lazy load RSC on demand"
=> some problems if you wanna build a package
  => there is currently no "revalidate this RSC" / "redirect(/foo)" and similar generic helpers that would work everywhere

-> Right now packaged RSCs are just a more native way the [...api] packaging we've been doing
